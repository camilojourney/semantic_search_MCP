# docs — codesight

Project documentation index.

## Contents

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [vision.md](vision.md) | Product vision and goals |
| [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) | Versioned feature roadmap |
| [decisions/](decisions/) | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) |
| [playbooks/](playbooks/) | Step-by-step operational guides |

## Rules

**Only these four categories belong in `docs/`.**
Do not create new top-level docs files without a corresponding ADR justifying it.

For feature specifications, use `specs/` instead.
For agent instructions, use `.claude/agents/`.
For self-improvement logs, use `.self-improvement/`.
