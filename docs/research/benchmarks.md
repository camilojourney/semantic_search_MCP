| Hybrid+RRF over BM25 | Elasticsearch | Precision@5 | +17pp over pure BM25 | Elastic 2025-2026 [VERIFIED, Grade C — vendor] |
| Hybrid + reranker | Elasticsearch | Precision | 93% | Elastic 2025-2026 [VERIFIED, Grade C — vendor] |

Reranking impact by query type (ailog.fr study):

| Query Type | Accuracy Improvement | Source |
|------------|---------------------|--------|
| Complex queries | +52% | ailog.fr [UNVERIFIED, Grade C — source cites "MIT research" with no DOI] |
| Multi-hop queries | +47% | ailog.fr [UNVERIFIED, Grade C] |
| Simple fact lookups | +18% | ailog.fr [UNVERIFIED, Grade C] |
| Average across benchmarks | +20-40% (conservative range) | Multiple sources [VERIFIED, Grade B] |

Note: The specific +33.1% average from ailog.fr cannot be traced to any published paper. The blog cites "MIT researchers" but no DOI or paper link exists. Use conservative "+20-40% range" based on corroborating sources. [UNVERIFIED, Grade C]

Cross-encoder reranking pipeline: retrieve 50-100 candidates, rerank to top 10. MRR@10 = 0.695 at 125ms latency. [VERIFIED, Grade B — BSWEN + ailog.fr corroboration]

### 1.2 Our Benchmarks

No internal benchmarks run yet.

| Config | Test Set | Precision@5 | Recall@10 | Date Run |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| TBD | CodeSight docs corpus | TBD | TBD | — |

> Run command: `pytest tests/benchmarks/ -v --benchmark-json=results.json`

Priority benchmarks to implement:
1. Hybrid search (BM25+vector+RRF) vs pure vector on CodeSight docs
2. With vs without reranker (MiniLM-L-6-v2) on top-10 precision
3. Chunking strategy comparison (512 vs 1024 tokens, with/without overlap)

## 2. Latency

| Operation | P50 | P95 | P99 | Conditions | Source |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|------------|--------|
| Vector search (1M vectors) | ~3ms | ~5ms | N/A | IVF-PQ, 960-dim, SSD | LanceDB team [UNVERIFIED, Grade C — vendor benchmark] |
| Vector search (50M vectors) | 30.75ms | 36.73ms | 38.71ms | HNSW, 768-dim, Qdrant | Qdrant official [VERIFIED, Grade B] |
| BM25+vector hybrid overhead | +15ms | N/A | N/A | Over pure vector | BSWEN [VERIFIED, Grade B] |
| MiniLM-L-6-v2 rerank (2 docs, CPU) | 45ms | N/A | N/A | CPU | BSWEN [CORRECTED — original "<50ms for 20 docs" was wrong; 45ms is for 2 docs only] |
| MiniLM-L-6-v2 rerank (20 docs, CPU) | ~200-400ms | N/A | N/A | CPU, estimated from throughput | Derived [VERIFIED, Grade C] |
| BGE-v2-m3 rerank (3 docs, CPU) | ~350ms | N/A | N/A | CPU | BSWEN [VERIFIED, Grade B] |
| nemotron-1b rerank (GPU) | 223ms | 351ms | N/A | GPU | AIMultiple [VERIFIED, Grade B] |
| Full pipeline (hybrid+rerank) | ~285ms | N/A | N/A | Hybrid 95ms + rerank 190ms | BSWEN [VERIFIED, Grade B] |

Reranking adds +120-400ms latency depending on model and candidate count. Acceptable for most use cases; for sub-100ms, rerank only small candidate subsets. [VERIFIED, Grade B]

Hybrid search resource overhead: ~30% slower ingestion, 25-35% more memory (dual BM25 + vector indexes). Worth it for +22pp Recall. [VERIFIED, Grade B — multiple benchmarks]

## 3. Cost Projections

### 3.1 Embedding Costs

| Scenario | Monthly Cost | Breakdown | Source |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| 10K docs, OpenAI API | ~$0.50 | text-embedding-3-small at $0.02/1M tokens, ~25M tokens | Calculated from OpenAI pricing [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| 100K docs, OpenAI API | ~$5.00 | ~250M tokens | Calculated [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| 1M docs, OpenAI API | ~$50/mo (re-indexing) | ~2.5B tokens | Calculated [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| Self-hosted nomic-embed (24/7) | $384/mo fixed | AWS g4dn.xlarge | AWS pricing [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| Self-hosted bge-m3 (24/7) | $734/mo fixed | AWS g5.xlarge | AWS pricing [VERIFIED, Grade A] |

Break-even: self-hosting at $384/mo beats OpenAI API when processing >19.2B tokens/month at text-embedding-3-small rates. For most startups (<1M docs), API is cheaper. [VERIFIED, Grade B]

### 3.2 LLM Costs (RAG Synthesis)

| Scenario | Monthly Cost | Breakdown | Source |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| 50 users, 20 queries/day, Sonnet 4.6 | ~$270/mo | ~3M tokens/day input (2K context/query), ~300K output | Calculated from Anthropic pricing [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| 50 users, 20 q/day, Sonnet + caching | ~$80/mo | 78% savings from prompt caching | Anthropic [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| 50 users, 20 q/day, Haiku 4.5 | ~$90/mo | Same volume, $1/$5 pricing | Calculated [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| 50 users, 20 q/day, GPT-4.1-nano | ~$10/mo | $0.10/$0.40 pricing | Calculated [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| 500 users, Sonnet + caching | ~$800/mo | 10x scale | Calculated [VERIFIED, Grade A] |

### 3.3 Infrastructure Costs

| Component | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| LanceDB (self-hosted) | $0 | Embedded, runs on app server |
| LanceDB Cloud | Usage-based (GA, launched June 2025) | $100 free credits for new users. No published fixed-price tier — calculator estimates ~$16/mo for minimal workloads. [CORRECTED — was "beta"; VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| App server (t3.medium) | ~$30/mo | FastAPI + LanceDB |
| GPU server (g4dn.xlarge) | $384/mo | Embedding + reranking |
| Total self-hosted stack | ~$414-$800/mo | Depends on LLM usage |

### 3.4 Cost Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Savings | Mechanism | Evidence |
|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Prompt caching (5-min TTL) | 78% on cached reads | Anthropic 90% input discount on cached prefixes | Anthropic [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| Extended caching (1-hour TTL) | Higher for session RAG | 2x write cost but amortized over longer sessions | Anthropic [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| Semantic caching | 68.8% cache hit rate | Hash-based + semantic similarity on query embeddings. Cache similar queries → reuse LLM response. | GPTCache, multiple studies [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| LLMLingua prompt compression | Up to 20x compression | Token pruning before LLM call, preserves key info | Microsoft Research [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| Intelligent LLM routing | 70-85% cost savings | Route simple queries to cheap models (Haiku/nano), complex to Sonnet | RouteLLM, multiple [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| Batch API (async 24h) | 50% discount | Anthropic + OpenAI both offer async batch processing | [VERIFIED, Grade A] |

Semantic cache risk: poisoned cache entries can serve malicious responses. See security.md §4 for SAFE-CACHE defense. [VERIFIED, Grade B]

### 3.5 Full Stack Cost Scenarios

| Tier | Users | Monthly Total | Breakdown |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| MVP (API-only) | 50 | ~$115-205/mo | OpenAI embed ($5) + Haiku/Sonnet cached ($80-170) + server ($30) |
| Growth (self-hosted embed) | 200 | ~$500-900/mo | Self-hosted embed ($384) + Sonnet cached ($200-400) + server ($30) |
| Scale | 500+ | ~$1,200-2,000/mo | Self-hosted embed+rerank ($384) + Sonnet cached ($800) + infra ($100) |

## 4. Hallucination Rates

### 4.1 RAG vs No-RAG Impact

| Approach | BERTScore (HotPotQA-Small) | BERTScore (SQuAD-Small) | Source |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Dense RAG Top-10 | 0.7516 | 0.8035 | arXiv 2412.15605, ACM WWW 2025 [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| Sparse RAG (BM25) | 0.7461 | 0.8191 | Same paper [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| CAG (full context) | 0.7759 | 0.8265 | Same paper [VERIFIED, Grade A] |

CAG advantage over best RAG variant: +1-4% BERTScore (modest). Speed: ~40x (2.33s vs 94.35s). CAG only viable when corpus fits in context window. [VERIFIED, Grade A — arXiv 2412.15605]

### 4.2 Retrieval Quality Impact on Hallucination

| Factor | Impact | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Hybrid search (vs vector-only) | +22pp Recall@50 = fewer missed relevant docs | BSWEN [VERIFIED, Grade B] |
| Cross-encoder reranking | +17pp Precision@10 = more relevant docs in context | BSWEN [VERIFIED, Grade B] |
| Reranker cannot fix recall | If doc missed in retrieval, reranker cannot recover it | BSWEN [VERIFIED, Grade A — architectural constraint] |
| "Lost in the Middle" | LLMs forget info buried in long contexts — degrades "catastrophically, not gradually" | Stanford/Berkeley research [VERIFIED, Grade B] |

### 4.3 RAG Poisoning Impact

| Attack | Impact | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| PoisonedRAG (5 docs in millions) | ~90% attack success rate | USENIX Security 2025 [VERIFIED, Grade A] |
| Multi-layer defense | 73.2% → 8.7% attack success (88.1% reduction) | arXiv 2511.15759 [VERIFIED, Grade B — preprint] |

### 4.4 Open Questions

- [ ] What is CodeSight's baseline hallucination rate without RAG?
- [ ] How does chunking strategy affect hallucination (512 vs 1024 tokens)?
- [ ] What is the false positive rate of guardrails on legitimate queries?
